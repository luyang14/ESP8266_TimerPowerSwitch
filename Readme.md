#ESP8266_TimerPowerSwitch

This project provides code that is a replacement for the code on the SONOFF BASIC. The original plan was to provide something that could run autonomously but it would be possible for another device to take control of it. It has been adapted to accomodate the requirements of the ESP Solax Monitor Project.
